// JavaTPoint

// 1. reference=another name to an existing variable
// 1. pointer=variables that store the address of another variable

// 2. reference CANNOT be reassigned
// 2. pointer CAN be reassigned

// 3. reference and pointer, both refer to same address of memory

// ex. reference:  int &b=a;  b will refer to address of a
// ex. pointer: int *c=&a; c will store the address of a

// 4. reference value CANNOT be NULL
// 4. pointers value CAN be NULL

// 5.Indirection
// 5. reference to reference NOT possible
// 5. pointer CAN have pointer to pointer , offering more than one leve of indirection

// 6.Arithmetic operations
// 6. reference aritmetic operations NOT possible
// 6. pointer arithmetic operations possible
