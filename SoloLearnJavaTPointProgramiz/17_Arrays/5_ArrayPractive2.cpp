// You are given an array of doubles of items in a store that have different prices(see template).
// Write a program that takes the "percent off" discount as input and outputs discounted item prices
// on one line in the same sequence you are given, separated by a space(" ").

// To get a discounted price use the formula : a â€“ a *p / 100,
// where a is the initial price and p is the discount percent off.
